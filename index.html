            <h1>Why story telling mindfullness?</h1>
            <p>The dynamic, inventive, and participatory nature of storytelling allows it to connect with a portion of our
                minds and bodies that makes us feel entire. It broadens our perspective of who we are and the abilities we
                already possess. It also strengthens our conviction that, at our heart, we are imaginative, playful beings,
                and that it is this aspect of ourselves that enables us to change, develop, and heal.<br>

                <h3>Self-Discovery and Reflection</h3>

                    themselves as they share personal stories. Reflecting on one's life experiences through storytelling can
                    be therapeutic and contribute to personal growth.</p>
